Q1:Write a function expanding(l) that takes as input a list of integer l and returns True if the absolute difference between each adjacent pair of elements strictly increases.
def expanding(l):
    pos = 1
    while (pos < len(l)-1):
        x = abs(l[pos] - l[pos-1])
        y = abs(l[pos+1]- l[pos])
        if y <= x:
            return False
            
        pos = pos+1
    else:
        return True

Q2:Write a Python function sumsquare(l) that takes a nonempty list of integers and returns a list [odd,even],
where odd is the sum of squares all the odd numbers in l and even is the sum of squares of all the even numbers in l.

def sumsquare(l):
    if len(l) == 0:
        return()
    else:
        sum_odd = 0
        sum_even = 0
        for i in l:
            if i%2 == 0:
                sum_even += i*i
            else:
                sum_odd += i*i 
        return ([sum_odd, sum_even])  

Q3:Write a Python function transpose(m) that takes as input a two dimensional matrix m and returns the transpose of m.

def transpose(l):
    row = len(l)
    col = len(l[0])
    new_list = [[0 for i in range(row)] for j in range(col)]
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[0])):
            new_list[i][j] = l[j][i]
    return new_list      













The argument m should remain undisturbed by the function.
